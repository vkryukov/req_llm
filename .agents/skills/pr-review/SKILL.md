# PR Review

Review this Pull Request: <url>

Add a GIT remote for the branch of the pull request so we can push changes to the remote branch.

Analyze the quality of the code, the tests and the overall change. Check for merge conflicts with `main`, advise on fixes if a conflict exists.

Give me feedback on the PR and if it is ready to merge.

If asked to give feedback on the PR, do so with a terse response in a encouraging, warm and friendly tone. Be appreciative of the work and the effort put into the PR.
